====== Using this Incident Response Log ======
===== Taxonomy =====
This response log relies upon DokuWiki namespaces for its organization.  
==== Security Incident section ====
To enable the use of temaplates, the security incident section is further broken down into further namespaces.  These are:
  * ir (General Security incidents, tracking, and reports)
  * Intelligence Collection
      * actor (Information regarding a specific actor)
      * group (Information regarding a specific group)
      * intrusionset ([[Intrusion Set]], essentially, a collection of incidents)
      * malware (Malicious code descriptions and analysis reports)
      * exploits (specific information about exploit kits and malicious code)
      * intrusionset (tracking of a specific [[Intrusion Set]]
      * thirdpartyintel (Third Party Intelligence)
  * legal (Legal matters and investigations)
  * drec (Data Recovery)


To use one of these, you either click in to the namespace and create a new page, or you create a page and explicitly identify the namespace by creating a document with the namespace prepended.  So, if you would create a page for a new actor, you would identify it like this:
  [[actor:newactor]]

Which would create a page for newactor using the Actor template.  Or you can do this:
  [[ir:2013-01-01a]]

Which would create a page for newactor using the incident response template.  Do the same thing for any of the other security namespaces.
