====== Summary ======
The security incident and intrusion response log is a record of internal and external security incidents warranting further investigation by the InfoSec and SOC teams.  This log aims to generate intelligence from the data collected and research performed during response procedures.  The intelligence should then -where practicable- be fed back into perimeter and prevention systems so as to protect the network.
