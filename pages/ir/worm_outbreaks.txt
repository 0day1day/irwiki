===== Objective =====
This document lists the actions and procedures required in the event malicious code with worm characteristics begins propagating on the network.


===== Response Phases =====

==== Preparation Phase ====

Responders must have:

  * administrative access to the suspicious system, 
  * the ability to remotely execute commands on the suspicious system, 
  * in some cases, GUI access to the suspicious, and
  * when necessary, physical access to the suspicious system



==== Protection Phase ====

To protect from worm outbreaks, systems should employ:

  * Up-to-date antivirus software installed, 
  * Host-based network protection measures, and 
  * Network-based network protection measures.
  * Minimize the number of allowed protocols within the network and across Internet gateways,
  * Restricted use of the network through technologies such as Network Access Control, and
  * A patch management program which encompasses endpoints and server hosts.

==== Detection Phase ====
Detection of a worm on the network will usually come from one of two sources:

  * A large number of A/V alerts from different systems concerning the same type of malware, or
  * A spike in a type of traffic (e.g. SMB) on multiple network segments.

==== Triage Phase ====
