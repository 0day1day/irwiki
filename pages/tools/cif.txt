====== Collective Intelligence Framework ======
===== Summary =====
{{https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/|CIF}} is essentially a large repository and clearing-house for threat indicators, or [[Indicators of Compromise]].  It has a feed-parser pulls everything you tell it to (eg: threat feeds, RT feeds, etc) and normalizes all the un-organized data into a massive repository so that over time; you develop a chronological repo of threat (or describing) data about as many observations of data as possible.

**Every search creates an entry in the database**, which is a good thing as this informs you that other people are searching for the same thing you are.  If you are searching just to see if there is a match, then use the _-n_ "no log" switch to perform a silent query.

The key here, is that it parses various data-formats (xml, rss, text, csv, etc) and normalizes so you can search it, compare it, correlate it across feed sources during an investigation. 
===== System Info =====
==== Server Information ====
   * Servername: coriolanus.jnpr.net
   * Linux-based
   * SSL protected
   * API key authorization
   * Comprises the [[Threat Indicator Database]]
==== Indicator Classifications ====
Indicators are classified into "groups" based on the sensitivity of the information.  A user with a valid API key may have access to one or more of the following groups.  The ability to submit data (write to the database)
   * **everyone** the default group, open to everyone on the system and any system that federates with our instance
   * **confidential** company confidential information.  Most data should be submitted as this, and it still has a wide audience
   * **limited** information only available through an NDA or other limited sharing arrangement
   * **compartmentalized** information that is very sensitive and only has a limited distribution

===== Getting Started with CIF =====
==== Installing the CIF client ====
  * Install {{http://www.perl.org/|perl}}
  * Install the client library with the following command

  sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install CIF::Client'

  * Cif looks for a configuration file in your $HOME
  * Edit your .cif configuration file, it should look something like this:

  [client]
  host = https://coriolanus.jnpr.net:443/api
  apikey = aaaaaaaaa-bbbb-xxxx-yyyy-zzzzzzzzzzzz
  timeout = 60
  verify_tls = 0

==== Performing a Query ====
ipv4-addr query
<code console>
$ cif -q 130.201.0.1
Query: 130.201.0.1
