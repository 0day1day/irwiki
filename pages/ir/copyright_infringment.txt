Dear XXXXX,

Thank you for contacting our incident response team and reporting this alleged copyright violation.  Internally, we have identified this as Incident XXXXX; please include this number in all further correspondence.

We are actively investigating the matter and working to correlate the information you provided with our logs.  Due to the high volume of requests, and the difficulty in pin-pointing an internal system with so little information, this may take some time.  If you have further information to share that would help speed up or increase the validity of our findings, please send that to us.  The destination IP address would be extremely helpful.

We will send a followup note when we have either identified the source of the traffic or determined that we cannot determine the system with a high degree of validity.

thank you,
Information Security

Unfortunately, we are unable to correlate the information provided by you with any system that may have been the cause of this traffic.  Due to the high volume of data flowing in and out of our egress points, we will need some more information.  The destination IP address would be extremely helpful.

If you have further information to share that would help speed up or increase the validity of our findings, please send that to us.  Otherwise, we will consider the matter closed.
