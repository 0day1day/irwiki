====== Summary ======
Welcome to the Incident response log and tracking system.  This system is based on the DokuWiki software, with some plugins and modifications applied from Scott Roberts' [[http://sroberts.github.com/sapho/|Sapho Intelligence project]].  You should only have access to those sections for which you have a valid need to know.  If for any reason, you believe that the ACLs for a given page or namespace are incorrect, please notify your incident response lead.

===== Security Intelligence and Intrusion Response ======
[[ir: | Security Incident Response Log]]  This is the primary area for security incidents.
